# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript project 0 calls for a personal site containing a few pages on any subjects. This site serves to satisfy those requirements. I have had some previous experience making basic websites.  However, this exercise has still proved very useful to me as I have not really explored SASS/SCSS before, and I have to say, I like it.

This is the most basic personal site (with little real personal information) imaginable, but it should suffice to demonstrate the principals. At least, I hope so.

## Pages
index.html is essentially a splash page, welcoming users to the site, and offering options of where to visit next.

About.html contains a list of questions and answers, in order to complete one of the requirements. It also has an image in the second of 2 columns to satisfy another requirement.

Photography.html contains a few photographs that are linked directly from my 500px account.

Equipment.html contains a table with a few items from my camera bag and their details. This also satisfies another requirement.
